====== Contacts ======

Each of your customer have different key stakeholders that you may correspond with during the course of business. These stakeholders are considered Contacts within the ITFlow system. When a Contact within a Client record submits a ticket via email into your ITFlow system, the ticket is automatically assigned to the relevant Client based on the email contact of the Contact.

Allow your clients to interact with the ITFlow portal by creating contacts.

You can record the following information about a client contact:

  * Name
  * Title
  * Mark as "important"
  * Mark as a technical / billing contact - this also allows them to see technical and/or billing info in the client portal
  * Department
  * Phone / Extension / Mobile
  * Location
  * Email
  * Notes
  * Portal Auth method (local/SSO)
