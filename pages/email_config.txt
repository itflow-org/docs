====== Outbound Email Configuration ======

ITFlow must be configured with your mail server settings to send outbound emails for things such as ticket notifications and invoices.

Configure at Settings > Mail:
  * SMTP Host
  * SMTP Port
  * Encryption
  * SMTP Username / Password
  * Outbound email to send as (use SMTP username if unsure) //(can be different for invoices/quotes/tickets)//
  * Outbound name to send as (e.g. ITFlow) //(can be different for invoices/quotes/tickets)//

===== Mail Queue ===== 

  * Messages are sent a queue-based system stored in the database, accessible via Settings > Mail Queue
  * The mail_queue.php [[cron|cron]] script checks for messages and attempts to send these
  * Messages that fail (e.g. config/mail server issues) to send can be manually retried

===== Microsoft 365 =====

  * SMTP: smtp.office365.com
  * PORT: 587
  * SMTP Username: your-email@yourdomain.com
  * SMTP Password: generate app password (see below setup)

Make sure your SMTP is enabled for your account (ask your provider to check, if you don't have admin access)
  - Open the Microsoft 365 admin center and go to Users > Active users.
  - Select the user, and in the flyout that appears, click Mail.
  - In the Email apps section, click Manage email apps.
  - Verify the Authenticated SMTP setting: unchecked = disabled, checked = enabled.
  - When you're finished, click Save changes.

Generating an app password requires MFA.
  - Go to the Security basics page and sign in to your Microsoft account (aka.ms/MFASetup).
  - Select More security options. 
  - Under App passwords, select Create a new app password. A new app password is generated and appears on your screen.
  - Enter this app password where you would enter your normal Microsoft account password in the application.


===== Google Workspace (Gsuite) =====
  * SMTP: smtp.gmail.com
  * PORT: 587
  * SMTP Username: your-email@yourdomain.com
  * SMTP Password: If your email password not working, try to generate app password (see below setup)

App Password
  - Go to your Google Account.
  - Select Security.
  - Under "Signing in to Google," select App Passwords. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:
    - 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.
    - 2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.
    - Your account is through work, school, or other organization.
    - You turned on Advanced Protection.
  - At the bottom, choose Select app and choose the app you using and then Select device and choose the device you’re using and then Generate.
  - Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
  - Tap Done.


===== Notes =====
  * Only supports **basic auth**entication. Many cloud providers consider this legacy. We aim to add support for OAuth in the future.
  * Email ticketing currently uses/relies on these SMTP credentials to connect
  * Known error: If mail settings are incorrect (e.g. encryption) the app can freeze up - [[https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/issues/696|GitHub issue]]
