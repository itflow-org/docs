====== API ======


Use ITFlow's API to work with ITFlow in scripts and (eventually) third-party apps.

The current version of the ITFlow API is v1. It can be accessed at **/api/v1/{module}/{function}.php**

===== Modules with API support at present =====

  * assets
  * certificates
  * clients
  * contacts
  * credentials (logins)
  * domains
  * networks
  * software
  * tickets


===== API Functions =====

  * read
  * create //(partial)//
  * update //(partial)//
  * delete //(partial)//


  * //We may also add archive//
===== Generating an API Key =====

  - Navigate to the **Admin** panel
  - Click on **API**
  - Click on **New Key** to generate a new key
  - Select whether the key will have access limited to a specific client, or have access to data for all clients


===== Request Methods =====

  * GET - Retrieving (READ) data
  * POST - Inserting (CREATE), Updating (UPDATE) or Deleting (DELETE) data

==== Data Returned ====

  * Success - True/False
  * Message - Failure info / Helpful debug info
  * Count - Count of rows affected/returned
  * Data - The data requested/created/changed


==== Notes ====

  * For read requests, 50 records are shown by default. This can be adjusted by supplying the ''limit'' and ''offset'' parameters.
  * For POST requests, the ''client_id'' parameter is always required if the API key used has scope/access to all clients
  * Be sure to check your Apache/PHP error logs if you're running into issues

==== API Docs/Examples ====

Documentation / an example of how to use a module API endpoint is shown on that module's doc page. Additional examples are available [[https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow-api-powershell|here]].
