  - Commit your Changes (''git add something.txt && git commit -m 'Add some''')
  - Push to the Branch (''git push origin my-feature'')
  - Open a Pull Request, adusting the base from master to develop

======Maintainer Steps for monthly releases======

Once a month, we will merge develop into master:

  - Ensure testing has been completed as much as possible
  - In develop, increment version.php in the YY.M.V format (e.g. 25.1 for the first release in Jan 2025, 25.1.2 for the second release of Jan 2025, and 25.6 for the first release in June 2025)
  - Look over the recent changes and write a short release summary
  - Raise a PR to merge develop into master
  - Test a final time on PR Review & ensure no other issues (Sonar, Linting, etc)
  - Approve the PR & Merge
