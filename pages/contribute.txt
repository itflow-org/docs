===== I'm not a developer but want to try and contribute code =====


The core maintainers of ITFlow are more Sysadmins than developers. If you've got an idea of something you'd like to change in ITFlow, give it a try! This could be anything and doesn't have to be huge to be helpful to the project - fixing typos, adjusting icons, etc.

First, review the [[code_standards|code standards]] page. This will give you an idea of how we name variables and what files do what.

If you need some help with using Git/GitHub, [[https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/|this article]] is a great resource.

Once you've got a working [[installation|installation]], switch to a new branch (''git checkout -b mybranch'').

Locate the page that holds the functionality you'd like to amend and start making changes. It's usually helpful to break down your desired goal into small chunks you can incrementally add.

//If you're doing lots of work with forms (generally submitting to post.php), you might want to look into something like Burp Suite to speed things up.//

Once you've got your changes working, add & commit your files (''git add myfile.php && git commit -m "My change"''), and push them to your GitHub account (''git push origin mybranch'').

You'll be prompted to raise a pull request where we can discuss your changes and eventually merge them into ITFlow!
