====== Tickets ======

Tickets allow you to easily track issues and service requests from your clients.

==== Views ====

There are currently two main views for tickets

  * All tickets (from all clients)
{{:tickets-listing.png?900|}}

  * Client-specific tickets - accessed via a client's view/page
{{:client-tickets-list.png?900|}}


==== Fields ====

  * Subject
  * Ticket description
  * Client & Contact
  * Priority (low/med/high)
  * Status (open, working, hold, auto-close, closed)
  * Related asset (future feature is to allow multiple assets)


==== Features ====

  * Agent Assignment/Re-assignment
{{:tickets-assign_agent.png|}}
  * Custom ticket prefix
{{:ticket-settings-ticket_prefix.png|}}
  * Time tracking
{{:tickets-time_tracking.png|}}
  * Email integration
{{:tickets-public_updates.png|}}
  * Private/internal notes
{{:tickets-private_notes.png|}}
  * Merging

  * Scheduled/Recurring tickets
{{:scheduled-tickets-create.png?500|}}
  * Invoicing
{{:tickets-invoice.png?300|}}

  * Resolved - A ticket is resolved before being closed. Agents and client contacts can re-open resolved tickets for 72 hrs (configurable) before they automatically close. 

  * Close - Once a ticket is closed, it cannot be re-opened

==== Email Ticketing ====
Registered client contacts can create/update tickets via e-mail.
  * Configure at: **Settings > Mail**:
    * IMAP Host, Port, Encryption
    * Ticket from email/name
  * Turn on: **Settings > Ticket > Email-to-ticket parsing**
  * Add a cron job to run email_parser_cron.php every min

=== Notifications ===
  * Client notifications can be configured to be sent on ticket creation & closure //("Send clients general notification emails")//
  * New ticket email notifications can be configured to a email/distribution list, so your team is always aware of new tickets //("Email address to notify when new tickets are raised")//
  * IN PROGRESS: Agents will be notified when assigned a ticket & when their assigned ticket is replied to / updated

==== Notes ====
  * Only supports basic authentication (no oAuth) for now - a "nice to have" in the future
  * Emails from unregistered contacts without a ticket reference are ignored (unless the from domain matches a domain registered in ITFlow)
  * Client contacts with the "Technical contact" role are able to see all tickets under their Client
==== API ====
/api/v1/tickets

**Read - Retrieve ticket information (/read.php) (GET)**
  * **Default / No params - Returns all tickets**
  * ticket_id - Specific ticket ID from the ITFlow database (may, but usually shouldn't, differ from ticket number)
