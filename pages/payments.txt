====== Payments ======
Review all of your client's payments towards invoices in one place.

{{payments.png?700|}}


The following information is recorded for each payment:
  * Payment Date
  * Invoice Date
  * Invoice id/ref
  * Client
  * Amount
  * Payment method (cash/cheque/Stripe)
  * Reference
  * Account credited

===== Notes =====

  * You cannot add/remove a payment directly from the payments page - you have to apply/remove the payment against an invoice
  * Removing a Stripe payment does not automatically refund it in Stripe
