====== Config.php ======

Basic configuration settings for ITFlow exist in ''config.php''. This file is automatically generated during setup.
You may need to tweak these values occasionally.

===== MariaDB Database details =====


  * ''$dbhost'' - Database host (generally localhost, but doesn't have to be)
  * ''$dbusername'' - Username to login to database
  * ''$dbpassword'' - Password to login to database
  * ''$database'' - Database name (e.g. ITFlow)
  * ''$mysqli'' - PHP Variable used to connect to database throughout app

===== Setup enabled =====

  * ''$config_enable_setup'' - Used to prevent re-setting up ITFlow once installed & setup

===== Install ID =====

  * ''$installation_id'' - Used to track your installation when opted in to telemetry

===== Repo Branch =====

  * ''$repo_branch'' - Used to specify the GitHub branch to update against (usually //master//, but change to //develop// if required)

===== Application instance name =====

  * ''$config_app_name'' - Name of your app, will appear in various places (e.g. myITFlow)

===== Application URL =====

  * ''$config_base_url'' - The home/base URL for your app. This is used when generating/sending links (cron, client portal SSO, emailed ticket updates) (e.g. demo.itflow.org)


===== HTTPS enabled status =====
 //(Intended for development purposes only)//
  * ''$config_https_only'' - If you need ITFlow to work without HTTPS, you need to set this variable to ''false''. Otherwise login cookies won't be set, and you will **not be able to login**.

===== GET IP Method =====
 //(Not configured by default)//
  * ''DEFINE('CONST_GET_IP_METHOD', 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR');''
By default, ITFlow will retrieve IP addresses using PHP's //REMOTE_ADDR//. If you are using a reverse-proxy, you'll need to configure ITFlow to use the //Forwarded For// header instead.
