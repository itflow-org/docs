====== Cron ======

ITFlow includes PHP scripts designed to run automatically via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron|Cron]], ensuring background tasks execute without user interacton. We strongly recommend configuring Cron.


==== Script purposes ====
All Cron scripts are now in the ''/cron/'' directory. There are several different cron scripts, each with a particular purpose:
  * ''cron.php'' - Daily maintenance tasks (cleanup, auto-closing resolved tickets, alerts, recurring invoices, etc.)
  * ''mail_queue.php'' - Sends e-mails (SMTP)
  * ''ticket_email_parser.php'' - Reads e-mails and creates/updates tickets (IMAP)
  * ''domain_refresher.php'' - Updates domain details (expiry, records, whois)
  * ''certificate_refresher.php'' - Updates certificate details (expiry, issuer, key)

  
==== Crontab file ====

To setup the scheduled tasks, copy the [[https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow-install-script/blob/main/cron.d-itflow|provided cron.d-itflow file]] to your system's cron directory (e.g. ''/etc/cron.d/itflow'').

//NB: If installed using the automated script after v25.10, this will have been done for you.//


==== Cron Activation ====
You must then activate Cron within ITFlow:

  * Sign in to ITFlow with administrative rights.
  * Navigate to **Settings** > **Notifications**
  * Enable Cron
