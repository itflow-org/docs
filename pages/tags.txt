  * choose the preferred color
  * look for icon from this url: https://fontawesome.com/v5/search?o=r&m=free and browse and select the icon you would like to associate with the tag name

in our example, we will need the handshake one, so on the font awesome website, you will see the code for it as: **fa-handshake** so we will use only the word: **handshake**. With other words, removed the **"fa-"**from the chosen icon
