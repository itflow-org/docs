====== Code Standards ======

We're trying to standardize the code for ITFlow to make it cleaner and easier to understand/contribute to. We see this as an ongoing, iterative process.

===== Variable Naming =====
  * Javascript - camelCase
  * PHP - under_score separator all lowercase

===== Formatting =====
  * Tab Spacing - Converting everything to 4 spaces
  * Generally moving towards PSR 1, but we're not too strict

===== SQL Table Structure =====
  * **Table Naming**: Using plural naming. Example users
  * **Column Naming**: Define by non-plural word of the table name separated with an underscore. Example table users has user_id user_first_name
  * **Primary Keys**: Defined first and are defined with the non-plural word of the table with id at the end example user_id
  * **Foreign Keys**: Defined by the linked table primary_key field name ex table name companies foreign key company_user_id links to table users primary key user_id
  * **Field Ordering**: Primary Key -> Data Fields -> created_at -> Foreign Keys

===== Code Structure =====
  * Procedural Code along with some object-oriented ideas. This makes the code clean and simple, as well as easy to contribute to.
  * Less is more approach, but sometimes more for better code explanation
  * Consider how others will use features. Generic features/code/concepts that can be useful to everyone are more helpful than a feature that solves your specific unique requirement.

===== File/Folder Structure =====
  * /api
    * /v1
      * /module/
  * /css
  * /js
  * /plugins
    * /bootstrap
    * /phpMailer
    * /Jquery
  * /uploads
  * /portal
  * /post
    * //individual modules// 

===== Crucial PHP Files =====
  * ajax.php - Used to dynamically load/populate content
  * post.php - This file is used for all forms to POST to as well as GET. This acts as both the "model" and "controller" in a traditional MVC architecture. Individual files are in the post directory
  * check_login.php - Checks to see if a user is logged in otherwise send to login screen
  * header.php - Beginning of HTML data and added CSS libraries
  * footer.php - End of HTML Data and added js Libraries
  * config.php - DB Connection and other defined PHP vars
  * README - General info about the app: Install guide, documentation, etc.
  * LICENSE - Licensing & copyright info
  * setup.php - Initial setup file (configures database, config.php, etc)

===== PHP File naming =====
''section_element_action_function.php''

E.g.:
  * user_add_modal.php
  * client_contact_add_modal.php
