=== Error Logs ===

It is usually helpful if you can provide specific error logs generated as a result of the issue. To do this:

  - SSH to your server
  - Tail the Apache2 error log by typing: <code>tail -F /var/log/apache2/error.log</code>
  - Perform the action that causes the issue/bug
  - Copy any new errors that are logged into your bug report


=== Cron Error Logs ===

If you're having issues with a script run via Cron failing, the logs for this won't be in the Apache error log. Adjust the Cron job to output to logger, and then grep syslog instead.
