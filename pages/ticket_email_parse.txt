====== Email ticketing ======

Client contacts can create/update tickets via e-mail.

1. Install PHP extensions: (//These will be installed if you installed via script method//)
  * php-imap
  * php-mailparse

2. Configure at Settings > Mail:
  * IMAP Host
  * IMAP Port
  * IMAP Encryption
  * IMAP Username
  * IMAP Password

3. Turn on: Settings > Ticket > Email-to-ticket parsing

4. Add a cron job to run //cron_ticket_email_parser.php// every minute (skip if you set it up [[cron#cron_scripts|earlier]] or installed using the [[installation_script|script]])

5. Decide whether you wish to automatically create tickets for every email, or just emails from client domains:

- Ensure that all clients have the correct 'domains' added in the Domain tracker module //(default)//, or

- Enable Admin > Ticket > "//Create tickets for emails from unknown senders/domains//"

====== How it works ======
  - Cron runs cron_ticket_email_parser.php
  - The email inbox is checked for unread messages
  - If an unread message is found, it's marked as read & checked for a ticket reference in the subject ((e.g. [TCK-091])
  - If there is a ticket reference
    - The ticket info is fetched & checked to be open
      - If the ticket is open, the reply is added
      - If the ticket is closed, an auto response is sent and a notification raised
  - If there isn't a ticket reference - it's treated as a new message
    - We check for an existing contact (based on the email) and raise the ticket under them
    - If there's no contact, we check if the from domain exists as a website for a client
      - If so, we create a new contact under that client for the user and raise the ticket under them
      - If not, we leave the email in the inbox to be actioned manually
  - If the email was successfully processed (e.g. a ticket raised / reply added) the message is moved to the ITFlow folder once attachments are processed

===== Notes =====
  * Only supports **basic auth**entication. This will not work with Microsoft as they require OAuth.
  * As closed tickets cannot be re-opened, replies to closed tickets raise a notification
  * Emails from addresses that can't be matched to a client (via registered domains), contact (via email), or existing ticket (via subject line) are left in the inbox and flagged for review
