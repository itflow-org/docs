===== Security message =====

  * This project is currently in **Beta** with many ongoing changes.

  * Whilst we're confident the majority of code is safe, nothing in life is 100% safe or risk-free. Writing functional, secure code is very difficult. The current fast pace of development/change may unintentionally introduce bugs/security issues. Use your best judgment before storing highly confidential information in the app. You may wish to consider running ITFlow on it's own server, using a web-app firewall, restricting access (except /portal) to trusted IP addresses, etc.

  * Need to report a security issue? Check the [[https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/security/policy|security policy]]
