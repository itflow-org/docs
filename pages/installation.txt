====== Requirements ======
  * [[https://debian.org|Debian Linux]] or Ubuntu Server with root shell access (SSH)
  * Some packages: [[https://httpd.apache.org|Apache]], [[https://mariadb.org|MariaDB]], [[https://php.net|PHP]], etc
  * Familiarity with the Linux shell
  * A little patience and willingness to troubleshoot when things go wrong


====== Choose your Installation Method ======

ITFlow is written in PHP and works best on Apache with MariaDB as the back-end database. We recommend running ITFlow on Debian using the installation script.

  * **[[installation_script|Installation via Script]] -- Recommended method ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKz9NOU_1XE|video]])**
  * [[installation_apt|Manual Installation on Debian]]
  * [[installation_hestiacp| HestiaCP Install]]
  * [[installation_docker|Installation via Docker Container]] //(unsupported)//

//You're more than welcome to try other methods and ways of running ITFlow, but it will be bumpy & have very limited support. We assume that if you're comfortable enough to deviate from the methods above, you're comfortable to debug the entire stack on your own.//

====== Post-installation essential housekeeping ====== 

A few steps to ensure everything stays running smoothly:

  * [[backups|Backups]]: Especially your master encryption key
  * [[cron|Cron]]: For scheduled activities //(the install script adds these for you)//
  * [[email_config|Outbound Emails - Email SMTP Configuration]]: To send outbound emails (invoicing, tickets, etc)
  * [[ticket_email_parse|Inbound Emails - Email to Ticket]]: To parse inbound emails & create/update tickets 
  * [[config_php|Config.php]]: Check you don't need to add any specific variables (e.g. If you're behind a WAF, or not using HTTPS)
