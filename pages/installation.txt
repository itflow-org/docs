====== Requirements ======

**Operating System**:
  * [[https://debian.org|Debian Linux]] or [[https://ubuntu.com/download/server|Ubuntu Server]] with root shell access (SSH).
  * Ensure the server is updated to the latest stable release for security and performance improvements.

**Software Packages**:
  * [[https://httpd.apache.org|Apache]]: A robust and widely-used web server software.
  * [[https://mariadb.org|MariaDB]]: A reliable and open-source relational database management system.
  * [[https://php.net|PHP]]: A popular server-side scripting language for web development.
  * Additional packages may be required depending on specific project needs.

**Technical Skills**:
  * Familiarity with the Linux shell, including basic commands and navigation.
  * Experience with package management tools like `//apt//` or `//apt-get//` for installing and updating software.

**Personal Attributes**:
  * A little patience and willingness to troubleshoot when things go wrong.
  * Problem-solving skills to diagnose and resolve issues that may arise during setup or operation.

====== Choose your Installation Method ======

ITFlow is written in PHP and works best on Apache with MariaDB as the back-end database. We recommend running ITFlow on Debian using the installation script for optimal performance and ease of setup.

  * **[[installation_script|Installation via Script]] -- Recommended method ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKz9NOU_1XE|video]])**
    * This method automates the setup process, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured. It's ideal for users who prefer a straightforward and hassle-free installation.

  * [[installation_apt|Manual Installation on Debian]]
    * Suitable for users who prefer manual control over the installation process. This method involves step-by-step commands to install and configure ITFlow and its dependencies.

  * [[installation_hestiacp| HestiaCP Install]]
    * HestiaCP is a control panel that simplifies the management of web hosting environments. This installation method is ideal for users who are already using HestiaCP and want to integrate ITFlow.

  * [[installation_docker|Installation via Docker Container]] //(unsupported)//
    * Docker provides a containerized environment for running applications. This method is suitable for users familiar with Docker who want to isolate ITFlow in a container. Note that this method is unsupported and may require additional configuration steps.

//You're more than welcome to try other methods and ways of running ITFlow, but it will be bumpy & have very limited support. We assume that if you're comfortable enough to deviate from the methods above, you're comfortable to debug the entire stack on your own.//
====== Post-installation essential housekeeping ====== 

A few steps to ensure everything stays running smoothly:

  * [[backups|Backups]]: Especially your master encryption key
  * [[cron|Cron]]: For scheduled activities //(the install script adds these for you)//
  * [[email_config|Outbound Emails - Email SMTP Configuration]]: To send outbound emails (invoicing, tickets, etc)
  * [[ticket_email_parse|Inbound Emails - Email to Ticket]]: To parse inbound emails & create/update tickets 
  * [[config_php|Config.php]]: Check you don't need to add any specific variables (e.g. If you're behind a WAF, or not using HTTPS)
