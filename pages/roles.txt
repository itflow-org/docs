====== User Roles and Permissions ======

Internal ITFlow users are assigned roles to manage their permissions. Roles for client contact users may come later, but are currently restricted to Primary Contact or being tagged as a Tech/Accounting contact.

Historically ITFlow was built with 3 roles: Technician, Account and Admin. Over time we found that this wasn't flexible enough so we've slowly added the ability to edit these roles and create your own.

Roles are managed in Admin Settings > Roles
  * Users can only be added to one role
  * Setting "Admin Access" on a role bypasses all permissions checks (user_role_is_admin)

**Modules**

Access to areas of ITFlow is now broken down into modules. In the database, these are stored in the appropriately named //modules// table:
  * client - General client & contact management
  * support - Access to ticketing, assets and documentation
  * credential - Access to client credentials - usernames, passwords and 2FA codes
  * sales - Access to quotes, invoices and products
  * financial - Access to payments, accounts, expenses and budgets. //If you're giving this role to a bookkeeper, give them at least read to sales too.//
  * reporting - Access to reports, in addition to other roles. To actually get anything useful, you need read rights to support or financial.

**Permissions**

You may be assigned the following permissions for each module:
  * Read (1)
  * Modify (2)
  * Delete (3)
